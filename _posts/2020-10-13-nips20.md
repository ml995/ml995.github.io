**Problem**: Consider drawing $N$ ($N \geq 3$) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) points uniformly from the interval $[0,1]$. Let the neighbor of a point be defined as the closest point to it, excluding itself. If the neighbor of the neighbor is the point itself, then we call this point a good point. In this context, we want to determine the expected number of good points, denoted by $f(N)$. Can we find a general expression for $f(N)$?
